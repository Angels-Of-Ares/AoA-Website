Angels Of Ares runs two unique programs for rewarding holders. One program is a native stake-by-holding program, and the second is a revenue program which comes from our various revenue streams, and is linked to our Angel Wings NFT. 

AoA rewards holders of both programs with $ALGO deposited directly to their wallets without any user interaction. We reward in $ALGO to avoid any selling pressure on the token, and to maintain a source of stable returns to our holders.
