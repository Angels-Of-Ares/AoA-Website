When Ares sought to plunge Earth into endless chaos, the heavens answered with divine fury... 

A host of celestial beings, the Angels of Ares, descended from the ethereal realms, not as his allies, but as his sworn opposition. 

Chosen for their strength, wisdom, and unbreakable resolve, the Angels were forged in battle to counter the Ares' relentless thirst for destruction. 

Though Ares thrives in war, the Angels do not battle for conquest but for balance. Bound by a sacred oath, they wield celestial might, each warrior an embodiment of divine justice. Alone, they are powerful. Together, they are unstoppable. As long as they stand, Ares' dominion over Earth will never come to pass. 

The war is eternal. The Angels of Ares will never falter. Yet, even among the divine, unity is fragile. 

The Angels are divided into two factions: The Light, who believe in guiding humanity through wisdom and protection, and The Dark, who see strength and dominance as the only path to survival. 

Their conflicting ideologies have sparked a civil war, a battle of light against shadow that threatens to tear their ranks apart. 

Though they stand united against Ares, their internal strife weakens them, as Ares watches, waiting for the moment to strike when their division will be his triumph. 

This begs the question...
