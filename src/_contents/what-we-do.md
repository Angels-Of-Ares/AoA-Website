## What we do

Angels Of Ares is an Elite Investment Club built on **Algorand**, consisting of an internal DGC, which stands for Decentralized Governed Community, where members of our DGC who we call our Divine Council, collectively decide on the progression of the club and how to allocate funds from our vault

The main focuses of the group are to establish **multiple streams of revenue**, both on Algorand and cross-chain. Our main investment focus is based in Aavegotchi, an NFT metaverse game built on the Polygon chain. The club also focuses on building a strong community, containing project creators, developers, analysts, and members of the Algorand community who come together to help each other build and grow Algorand as a whole

Angels Of Ares appeals to both the **passive investor**, looking to invest and grow their holdings over time through rewards and revenue programs, as well as the **active investor**, looking to join at the inner level as part of the Divine Council and is able to participate in the inner workings of the club.
